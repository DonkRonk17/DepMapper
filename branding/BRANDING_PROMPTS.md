## 1. TITLE CARD (16:9 Landscape - 1920x1080px)

**For:** GitHub repository header image, presentations, documentation

**DALL-E Prompt:**
```
Create a sleek, modern title card for "DepMapper" - a Python dependency mapper and circular import detector.

STYLE:
- Dark navy blue background (#0a0e27)
- Bright cyan accents (#00d4ff)
- Tech-forward, professional aesthetic
- Minimalist geometric patterns

LAYOUT:
- Large bold title "DEPMAPPER" centered in modern sans-serif font
- Smaller tagline below: "Python Dependency Mapper & Circular Import Detector"
- Central visual: An abstract directed graph/network with interconnected nodes and glowing edges, showing a dependency tree structure. Some edges glow in cyan, with one circular path highlighted in a warm red-orange to represent a detected cycle.
- Subtle circuit board or data flow patterns in the dark background
- Small decorative code bracket symbols along the edges

MOOD: Professional, analytical, cutting-edge developer tooling, part of Team Brain ecosystem
```

## 2. LOGO MARK (1:1 Square - 1024x1024px)

**For:** Profile pictures, app icon base, social media

**DALL-E Prompt:**
```
Create a minimalist logo icon for "DepMapper" - a Python dependency analysis tool.

STYLE:
- Simple geometric shape
- A stylized network/graph icon: 4-5 small square nodes connected by directional arrows forming a tree pattern, with one circular arrow loop highlighted
- Bright cyan (#00d4ff) nodes and edges on dark navy (#0a0e27) background
- Clean, recognizable at small sizes (32x32px)

DESIGN:
- Centered icon
- No text (icon only)
- Modern, professional
- The circular loop element subtly suggests "dependency cycle detection"
- Nodes are small rounded squares, edges are thin lines with small arrowheads

MOOD: Tech-forward, analytical, reliable, part of unified Team Brain ecosystem
```

## 3. HORIZONTAL LOGO (3:1 Wide - 1800x600px)

**For:** Documentation headers, website banners, presentations

**DALL-E Prompt:**
```
Create a horizontal logo banner for "DepMapper" - a Python dependency mapping tool.

STYLE:
- Dark navy background (#0a0e27)
- Bright cyan text and accents (#00d4ff)
- Network graph icon on the left side
- "DEPMAPPER" text in modern bold sans-serif font center-left
- Subtle tech patterns or gradients on the right side

LAYOUT:
- Left 20%: Stylized dependency graph icon (nodes and arrows)
- Center-left: "DEPMAPPER" in large modern font
- Right side: Abstract visualization of branching dependency tree lines extending outward, fading into the background
- Thin horizontal line accent below the text

MOOD: Professional, cohesive branding, developer-focused, Team Brain family
